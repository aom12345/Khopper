"""
dummy_strategies.py

This file contains ONLY:
    • The 5 Dummy Strategies used as examples / fallbacks.
    • Clean, per-strategy import logic for participant strategies.
    • No engine logic, no play_match, no deck, no evaluator.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
---------------------
This file acts as a "teaching set" for participants.
Each DummyStrategy shows HOW to use the information provided
by the engine in round1, round2, round3:
    - hole cards
    - community cards
    - stacks
    - pot
    - win_prob
    - r1_bets, r2_bets
    - tournament history
    - self.my_index

Participants who read this file understand:
    • What a strategy class looks like
    • What functions they must implement
    • What information they will receive each round
    • How to return legal actions/bets

        • win_prob is a number 0..1 (your estimated chance of winning).
        • You can scale your bets linearly using win_prob.
        • Fold when equity is very low.
